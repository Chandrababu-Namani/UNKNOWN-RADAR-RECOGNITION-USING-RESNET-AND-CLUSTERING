This includes both synthetic simulated channel effects and over-the-air recordings of 24 digital and analog modulation types has been heavily validated.

This dataset was used for Over-the-air deep learning-based radio signal classification published 2017 in IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing, which provides additional details and a description of the dataset.

Data was stored in hdf5 format as complex floating-point values, with 2 million examples, each 1024 samples long.
